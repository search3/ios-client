MAKE SURE TO `pod install` in the root project dir before running the app

The flask server should get the post data properly, you can update the url in the app within
`ImageProcessingController` line 116

ALSO IMPORTANT: the app uses a mock photo, you can use one you pick from the simulator using the commented
line 55 in `UploadViewController`
